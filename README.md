# Movie-Recommendator


A machine learning model for recommending five different movies relating to a single movie taken in input. 

It uses Count Vectorizer sklearn library for data preprocessing as most of the data is in textual format and it helps converting the data into single tag format. The model is trained on cosine similarity that measures the relative cosine distance of different movies and uses it to make the prediction.
