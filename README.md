# Movie-Recommendation


A machine learning model for recommending five different movies relating to a single film was taken into input. 

It uses the Count Vectorizer sklearn library for data preprocessing as most of the data is in textual format and it helps convert the data into a single tag format. The model is trained on cosine similarity that measures the relative cosine distance of different movies and uses it to make the prediction.
